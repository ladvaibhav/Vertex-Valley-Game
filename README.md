# Vertex Valley Game

Vertex Valley is a 2D top-down adventure game engine built from scratch using Java and Swing/AWT. The project focuses on implementing classic RPG mechanics, including tile-based exploration, precise collision detection, and dynamic object interaction.

Note: This project is currently under active development. 🛠️

## 🎮 Features
- **Tile-Based World:** A massive 50x50 grid-based world rendered from custom .txt map files.
- **Smooth Delta Game Loop:** Implements a high-precision game loop targeting a consistent 60 FPS.
- **Dynamic Object System:** A robust SuperObject system for interactive items like Keys, Doors, Chests, and speed-boosting Boots.
- **Collision Physics:** Custom CollisionChecker handling entity-to-tile and entity-to-object interactions using rectangle hitboxes.
- **Sprite Animation:** Four-directional movement with multi-frame sprite switching for fluid character movement.
